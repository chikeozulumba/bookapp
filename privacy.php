              information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized
              alteration by using industry-recognized security
              safeguards, coupled with carefully developed security
              procedures and practices. We maintain physical, electronic
              and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable laws
              and federal standards. Your sensitive information, such as
              credit card information, is secured during transactions.

            <h4 class="pull-left" id="bold">3.  SECURITY</h4><br><br>
            <p>
              We have in place appropriate technical and security
              measures to prevent unauthorized or unlawful access to

              Secure Socket Layer (SSL) coding. While we are unable to
              guarantee 100% security, this makes it hard for a hacker
              to decrypt your details. <br>
